This algorithm takes a video footage as input(put in the same folder as the program)
And it shows boxes around the vehicle with their calculated speeds
This video with speeds is also exported as a recording and saved in the same folder as the program
You can add any recording of a road with a camera mounted above any road, just change the name of video file in the code.
